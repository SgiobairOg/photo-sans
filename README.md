# Photographer Sans

I've never been good with cameras, especially not for night projects, but I have been fortunate enough to see so many beautiful and interesting places from beautiful Swiss mountainscapes to the solitude of the Pacific Ocean. Photographer Sans is going to be my place to try and convey the beauty of my world through wordsâ€”a photographer sans camera.
